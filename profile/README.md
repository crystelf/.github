# Hi there, this is Crystelf 👋

The Crystelf team is made up of a group of developers who love programming, value life and are grateful for it.

Our hardware room started from g41, and has evolved over the years, and is now equipped with multiple systems and full gigabit interconnections.

Our software system is currently in its infancy, and currently covers services such as:
- TRSS group robot
- crystelf cloud storage
- crystelf cloud function/api (planned)
- crystelf webpage.
- crystelf server management software

Our users have grown from a few to many users and developers with millions of messages.
