## The Crystelf team is made up of a group of developers who love programming, value life and are grateful for it.

- Our hardware room started from g41, and has evolved over the years, and is now equipped with multiple systems and full gigabit interconnections.

- Our software system is currently in its infancy, and currently covers services such as:
  - TRSS group robot
  - crystelf cloud storage
  - crystelf cloud function/api (planned)
  - crystelf webpage.
  - crystelf server management software

- Our users have grown from a few to many users and developers with millions of messages.
